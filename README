Stock market analysis is very important because it helps stock analysts to find out activity of an instrument/sector/market in future. By using stock analysis, investors and traders arrive at equity buying and selling decisions. Studying and evaluating past and current data helps investors and traders to gain an edge in the markets to make informed decisions.

Investors rely on stock analysis in helping them find a profitable stock. Stock market analysis helps the investors to identify whether the worth of security is valued in the market.

Analysis of stock market news is very important because Positive news will normally cause individuals to buy stocks. Good earnings reports, an announcement of a new product, a corporate acquisition, and positive economic indicators all translate into buying pressure and an increase in stock prices.

Social media platform like Twitter provide tweets which may be helpful for stock market analyst.

Suppose if he wants to get the count of those particular tweets which contain the names or shortforms of the companies which are listed in NSE (National Stock Exchange).

So by getting the latest count or by getting the count of previous 7 days, he can analyse and come to a conclusion that which company is in trending currently in news.

I have created a web application that shows the count of tweets (containing the names or short form of the companies listed in NSE ) in the form of a bar chart for previous 7 days.
